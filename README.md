# KivTris
Tetris Clone with Kivy+Python. Works on Android with buildozer

My goal was to create a game whith Python and Kivy. 
I chose Kivy because of Android and Windows functionality.

With buildozer it is even possible to create a playable Android apk.

So that's it:
my first python game.

As you can see, there is a lot of room for improvement:
- own class for gamefield
- Android-apk without keyboard-event and highscore 
- "screen2" (yep, deleted it) for Settings, Themes and Play Mode
